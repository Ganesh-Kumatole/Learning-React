### The `useId` Hook

**`useId`** is a React Hook for generating stable and unique IDs that can be used to link related HTML elements, most commonly a `<label>` with an `<input>`.

---

### The Problem it Solves: Accessibility and Reusability â™¿

For a form to be accessible, a `<label>` must be associated with its corresponding `<input>`. The standard way to do this is by matching the label's `htmlFor` attribute with the input's `id` attribute.

```html
<label htmlFor="user-name">Name:</label> <input id="user-name" type="text" />
```

This becomes difficult when you create a reusable component. If you hardcode an ID like `id="user-name"` and then use your component twice on the same page, you'll have **duplicate IDs**, which is invalid HTML and breaks accessibility for screen readers.

You also can't use something like `Math.random()` to generate an ID, because it would produce a new ID on every render, which is inefficient and breaks apps that use Server-Side Rendering (SSR).

### The Solution: How `useId` Works

The `useId` Hook solves this problem perfectly.

- **It's Stable:** The generated ID is consistent across re-renders for the same component instance.
- **It's Unique:** It guarantees the ID is unique across your entire application, even if you render the same component multiple times.
- **It's Server-Safe:** It works correctly with Server-Side Rendering, preventing mismatches between the server-generated HTML and the client-side React app.

#### How to Use It

You call `useId` at the top level of your component to generate the unique string, then assign it to the elements that need to be linked.

```jsx
import { useId } from 'react';

function EmailField() {
  // 1. Call the hook to generate a unique ID
  const id = useId();

  return (
    <div>
      {/* 2. Use the ID to connect the label and input */}
      <label htmlFor={id}>Email:</label>
      <input id={id} type="email" name="email" />
    </div>
  );
}

// Now you can reuse EmailField without any ID conflicts
function App() {
  return (
    <form>
      <EmailField />
      <hr />
      <EmailField />
    </form>
  );
}
```

In the example above, each `<EmailField />` instance will get its own unique ID (e.g., `:r1:` and `:r2:`), ensuring that both labels correctly point to their respective inputs.

### Important Rules

- **Do Not Use for List Keys:** `useId` should **not** be used to generate `key` props when rendering a list. List keys must be stable and derived from your data (e.g., `item.databaseId`).

- **Use as a Base ID:** If you need multiple unique IDs within a single component, call `useId` once to get a base ID and then use it as a prefix for the others.

  ```jsx
  const id = useId();
  // ...
  <label htmlFor={`${id}-firstName`}>First Name</label>
  <input id={`${id}-firstName`} type="text" />

  <label htmlFor={`${id}-lastName`}>Last Name</label>
  <input id={`${id}-lastName`} type="text" />
  ```
